# Agile Team Tools (Infrastructure)
Infrastructure as Code definitions to support the agile-team-tools project.

# Supported Platforms
There are many possible choices for defining infrastructure as code.  This solution currently uses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to define this., but it can be extended to any IaC platform that supports Azure.

## Terraform
The Terraform implementation can be found in the [src/terraform](src/terraform) directory.
