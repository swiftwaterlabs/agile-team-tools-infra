## Development Environment Setup
To configure your develpment environment, use the following steps:
1. Pull down the code from GitHub.
2. Change your working directory to src/Azure
3. Using Powershell run az login -t <tenant id>
```
az login -t 335776b5-3fba-4122-bcef-84458b1b8201
```
4. Initialize the project by running src/Azure/scripts/initialize.ps1

After changes are made, you can then plan and apply changes by running the src/Azure/scripts/plan.ps1 and src/Azure/scripts.apply.ps1 scripts.
